#### Rate Limiter - Token Bucket (`tokenbucket.py`)
This Python code provides an implementation of a token bucket algorithm for rate limiting. The token bucket algorithm is used to control the rate at which requests can be made to a service or resource, ensuring that requests do not exceed a specified rate.

The code includes a `TokenBucket` class that allows you to create and manage a token bucket with the following features:

- Add tokens to the bucket at a fixed rate over time.
- Handle incoming requests by checking token availability and allowing or declining requests based on the available tokens.
